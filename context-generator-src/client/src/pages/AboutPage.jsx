        <h2>What is <span className="text-orange">ContextForge</span>?</h2>
        <p>
          ContextForge is a specialized tool designed to create comprehensive context documents that semantically calibrate AI language models (like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) to your specific business needs, audience, and communication style.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike traditional documentation that's primarily meant for human consumption, these context documents are specifically optimized to help AI systems better understand your unique business context and generate more accurate, relevant, and precisely aligned outputs.

        <h2>How It Works with AI Systems</h2>
        <p>
          Modern AI systems are incredibly powerful but work best when provided with detailed, structured context about your specific needs. Our context documents serve as semantic calibration tools that can be:
        </p>
        <ul className="feature-list">
          <li>
            <strong>Attached to Conversations:</strong> Upload or paste these documents directly into AI chat interfaces to establish context
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Used for Knowledge Retrieval:</strong> Create dedicated knowledge bases or embeddings from these documents
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Integrated with AI APIs:</strong> Incorporate into your system prompts when building applications with AI APIs
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Referenced in Prompts:</strong> Refer back to specific sections in your ongoing conversations with AI systems
          </li>
        </ul>
